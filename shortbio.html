<h2>A Short Biography of Longhai Li</h2>
    
     
<p>Longhai Li received his PhD and M.Sc degrees in statistics from the <b>University of Toronto</b> (U of T). His doctoral supervisor was <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/homepage.html">Radford M. Neal</a>. Before that, he received his B.Sc in statistics from the <a href="">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). He joined the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Saskatchewan (U of S) in 2007. He became a full professor in 2018. His research interest lies mainly in two areas: (1) statistical machine learning for high-throughput data; (2) diagnostics and comparison of complex statistical models. He is also broadly interested in applications of machine learning in practical problems. His research has been funded by a few national grant agencies or programs, including NSERC, CFI, CFREF, and MITACS. The journals that he has published include: Journal of American Statistical Association, Bayesian Analysis, Statistics in Medicine, Statistics and Computing, Scientific Reports, PLOS ONE, BMC Bioinformatics, and many others. A predictive model comparison method developed by him, called integrated 
importance sampling (iIS), is included in this textbook by Peter Congdon: <a
