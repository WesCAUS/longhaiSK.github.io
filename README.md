# Canada Covid-19 Rt
Real-Time Estimates of the Effective Reproduction Rate 
(Rt) of COVID-19 of Canada
<br>
<br>


### Rt:

The effective reproductive number Rt is the average number of secondary cases per infectious case in a population made up of both susceptible and non-susceptible hosts. It also is the number of people in a population who can be infected by an individual at any specific time. If Rt > 1, the number of cases will INCREASE, such as at the start of an epidemic. If Rt = 1, the disease IS ENDEMIC. If Rt < 1, there will be a DECLINE in the number of cases.
