## The description of the dataset generating scheme is found from 
## Li, L. & Yao, W. Fully Bayesian logistic regression with hyper-LASSO priors for high-dimensional feature selection. Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation 88, 2827â€“2851 (2018).
## There are 4 groups of features:
##  feature #1: marginally related feature
##  feature #2: marginally unrelated feature, but feature #2 is correlated with feature #1
##  feature #3-10: marginally related features and also internally correlated
##  feature #11-2000: noise features without relationship with the y.
