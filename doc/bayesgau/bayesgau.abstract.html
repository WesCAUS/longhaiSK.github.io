There is an increasing demand for efficient, accurate and precise methods for predicting a discrete response with a great many of features, such as hyperspectral data generated by remote sensoring system, and gene expression data generated by microarray technology. For computational and other reasons, it is necessary to select a subset of features before ﬁtting a statistical model, by looking at how relevant the features are to predicting the response. However, such feature selection procedure will result in overconﬁdent predictions for future cases. Li, Zhang, and Neal (2008) present a general Bayesian method for avoiding this optimistic bias. The challenge in applying this method is the computation of an adjustment factor – the probability of a feature failing to pass the selection ﬁlter under the assumed Bayesian model. Li, Zhang, and Neal (2008) ﬁnd an efficient method to compute the adjustment factor for naive Bayes classiﬁcation models for binary features. In this paper, I show that efficient computation of the adjustment factor is also possible for Bayesian Gaussian classiﬁcation models for continuous features, when the features are selected by F-statistic. The classiﬁcation method presented in this paper is tested using a simulated data and a gene expression data that is related to small round blue cell tumors (SRBCT) of childhood.
